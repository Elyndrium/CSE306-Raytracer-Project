# CSE306 Raytracer Project
 Coding a simple raytracer in C++

".obj" meshes loadable using TriangleMesh class. Run with argument "help" for help on using the program.
Scene is modifiable in "main" function. Example render has been made with arguments ".\a.exe 1024 1024 20 3 1024 55 0.4 0.6"

TD1: Diffuse surfaces, direct lighting and shadows, mirrors, refraction and fresnel

TD2: indirect lighting for point light sources, antialiasing

TD3/4: ray-mesh intersection, UVs mapping, rescaling function, BVH not visiting boxes "further" than best intersection found

Additional: depth of field, motion blur, SAH bounding box algorithm (20s -> 16s on example scene), procedural textures (perlin)
